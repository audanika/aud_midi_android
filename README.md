# aud_midi_android

The Android backend of aud_midi: `android.media.midi` through jnigen
bindings and a small Java shim, AMidi through FFI for sending.

Part of the aud_midi family, see [aud_midi](https://github.com/audmidi/aud_midi).

## Goals

- USB, Bluetooth LE and virtual MIDI devices as ports
- MIDI 1.0 byte-stream devices and, from API 33, Universal MIDI Packets
- Android timestamps on input, AMidi with timestamps on output
- Java shim for the abstract callback classes, no MethodChannel
- The app's own virtual devices: `MidiDeviceService`, `MidiUmpDeviceService`
- `NsdManager` advertising and a multicast lock for network sessions
- BLE peripheral through BluetoothGattServer

## State

`AndroidMidiBackend` (name `android`) implements `MidiBackend` of
[aud_midi_core](https://github.com/audmidi/aud_midi_core):

- Ports: every port of every device the MIDI service knows: USB,
  Bluetooth and the virtual devices of other apps; from API 33 both
  transports (`getDevicesForTransport`). Android's input port, data into
  the device, is an output of the app and vice versa. Ids are
  `android:<device id>:in|out:<port number>`; Android assigns a new device
  id on re-plug, the `fingerprint` finds the candidates. Byte-stream
  devices speak MIDI 1.0; UMP devices take their protocol from
  `getDefaultProtocol` and exchange UMP words, big-endian in Android's byte
  arrays.
- Receiving: the shim's `AudMidiReceiver` copies every chunk with its
  timestamp into a buffer of 64 KiB per port and signals the isolate once;
  the isolate drains all chunks with one JNI call. A full buffer drops the
  newest chunk and counts it (`queueOverflow`). The timestamps,
  `System.nanoTime()` = `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, become package times through
  `MidiClockMapper`, measured again every 10 s and on hotplug.
- Sending: AMidi `sendWithTimestamp` from API 29, `MidiInputPort.send`
  below or when AMidi refuses a device (`nativeError` diagnostic). Chunks
  have at most 1012 bytes and never split a UMP. Outputs to USB and
  Bluetooth devices report `scheduledSend` and `cancelPending`: the MIDI
  service holds the data until they are due and drops them on a flush.
  A virtual device gets the timestamp with the data and decides itself, so
  the engine schedules for it.
- Hotplug: `AudMidiDeviceCallback` per transport → added, removed and
  changed ports; the open ports of a removed device are closed.
- `virtualPorts` (static): the ports of the app's own `AudMidiDeviceService`
  and `AudMidiUmpDeviceService` (or subclasses) from the manifest, listed
  with `isOwn`. `create(spec)` hands out a declared port, named like the
  spec or the first free one; Android creates none at runtime.
- `bluetooth`: Bluetooth LE scan with the BLE-MIDI service UUID filter,
  `connect` through `openBluetoothDevice`; the peripheral stays open until
  `disconnect`. Permissions per API level; a missing one throws
  `MidiPermissionDenied` and shows in `capabilities.missingPermissions`.
- `network` is null: Android has no network session. The umbrella
  composes the AppleMIDI session of aud_midi_network with
  `MidiAndroidServiceAdvertiser` (`NsdManager`); mDNS browsing needs a
  `MidiAndroidMulticastLock`.
- Isolates: package:jni loads classes through the application class loader
  its plugin captured and attaches threads on demand, so the backend runs
  in any isolate. The application context comes from the shim's content
  provider, or from the `context` parameter.

Verified on the Android emulator (API 36, arm64) with the
[example app](example/README.md) in a background isolate, debug and
release build (R8):

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Enumeration | MIDI 1.0 and UMP loopbacks, own MIDI 1.0 and UMP devices with `isOwn` |
| MIDI 1.0 loopback through AMidi, 3018 bytes with a 3000-byte SysEx | bytes and order unchanged, timestamps back within 0–2 µs |
| Packet due in 200 ms | timestamp equals the due time; arrives at once, a virtual device does not schedule |
| UMP loopback through AMidi, 607 words with 300 MIDI 2.0 notes | words and order unchanged |
| Latency from the Java receiver to Dart | 0.15–2.5 ms release, 7–12 ms debug |
| Own virtual devices, MIDI 1.0 and UMP | data in both directions, the other client sending through `MidiInputPort` and AMidi |
| `System.nanoTime()` stamp against the `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` reader | arrival 46–169 µs after the stamp: one clock |
| `cancelPending`, `MidiInputPort.flush` | no error |
| Bluetooth LE scan | starts and stops, finds nothing on the emulator |
| `NsdManager`, multicast lock | `_apple-midi._udp` registered and unregistered; lock held |
| `MidiEngine` over `AndroidMidiBackend` | typed messages unchanged; a note scheduled in software 1.5–1.9 ms after due; a MIDI 1.0 Note On to a MIDI 2.0 port arrives as MIDI 2.0 |
| Release build | R8 keeps all shim classes; same report |

Not verified: USB devices and real BLE-MIDI peripherals (no hardware),
API levels below 33 (no UMP) and below 29 (sending only through
`MidiInputPort`; that path ran on API 36 as the client of the own
device), hotplug of real devices. Their logic is tested with fakes.

Findings that shape the behaviour:

- Android cuts data longer than 1015 bytes into packets, inside UMP words
  too; the backend splits UMP data itself, between packets.
- A `MidiDeviceService` receives the timestamp but nothing schedules for
  it; only USB and Bluetooth devices sit behind the scheduler of the MIDI
  service.
- The `ServiceInfo` of a virtual device lies under the hidden property
  key `service_info`; the shim reads it to recognise the app's own
  devices.
- package:jni finds the shim classes from background isolates without
  extra setup; no class loader workaround is needed.

## Installation

```bash
dart pub add aud_midi_android
```

The package is an Android plugin without a Flutter dependency: Flutter
builds the Java shim into the app, R8 keeps it through the shim's
`consumer-rules.pro`. `minSdk` 24; AMidi is used from API 29, UMP devices
appear from API 33.

The app declares in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.software.midi" android:required="true" />
<!-- Bluetooth LE MIDI -->
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.bluetooth_le" android:required="false" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN"
    android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<!-- Network sessions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
```

The app requests the runtime permissions itself: `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` and
`BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` from API 31, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` below.

A virtual device of the app, inside `<application>`:

```xml
<service
    android:name="com.audanika.aud_midi_android.AudMidiDeviceService"
    android:permission="android.permission.BIND_MIDI_DEVICE_SERVICE"
    android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.media.midi.MidiDeviceService" />
    </intent-filter>
    <meta-data
        android:name="android.media.midi.MidiDeviceService"
        android:resource="@xml/midi_device_info" />
</service>
```

with `res/xml/midi_device_info.xml`:

```xml
<devices>
  <device manufacturer="My company" product="My app">
    <input-port name="My app in" />
    <output-port name="My app out" />
  </device>
</devices>
```

A UMP device (API 33) uses `AudMidiUmpDeviceService` with the action
`android.media.midi.MidiUmpDeviceService`, a `<property>` instead of
`<meta-data>` and `<port name="…" />` entries. Several devices need one
subclass each.

## Code Examples

```dart
import 'package:aud_midi_android/aud_midi_android.dart';
import 'package:aud_midi_core/aud_midi_core.dart';
import 'package:aud_midi_standard/aud_midi_standard.dart';

// Runs in an isolate of an Android app, e.g. the MIDI isolate.
Future<void> main() async {
  final engine = MidiEngine(backend: AndroidMidiBackend());
  await engine.open();
  for (final port in engine.outputs) {
    final output = await engine.openOutput(port.id);
    await output.send(const MidiNoteOn(channel: 0, note: 60, velocity: 100));
  }
  await engine.close();

  final registration = await MidiAndroidServiceAdvertiser().register(
    name: 'My session',
    type: '_apple-midi._udp',
    port: 5004,
  );
  await registration.unregister();
}
```

## Regenerating the bindings

The bindings are generated files in `lib/src/**/*.g.dart`. After a change
of the Java shim, `jnigen.yaml` or `ffigen.yaml`:

```bash
# jnigen: android.media.midi, Bluetooth, NsdManager, WifiManager, the shim
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
dart run jnigen:setup            # once: builds the API summarizer
dart run jnigen --config jnigen.yaml

# ffigen: AMidi from the NDK
NDK="$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/ndk/28.2.13676358"
SYSROOT="$NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/sysroot"
dart run ffigen --config ffigen.yaml \
  --compiler-opts "--target=aarch64-linux-android33 --sysroot=$SYSROOT"
```

Both use the Dart of the Flutter SDK (package:jni needs it) and produce
the same files again.

## How It Works

- Dart talks to Android only through `MidiAndroidPlatform`. Its JNI
  implementation and the AMidi glue are thin and run on Android only;
  everything else is plain Dart, tested on the development machine with
  fakes.
- Java threads never wait for Dart: the shim's callbacks are listeners
  that post to the isolate's port and return.
- Receiving: MIDI thread → `AudMidiReceiver.onSend` copies → one signal →
  the isolate drains the buffer → decode → port packets with times.
- Sending: package time → `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` through the clock mapper →
  AMidi or `MidiInputPort` with that timestamp.
